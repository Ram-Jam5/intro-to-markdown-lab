Sandwiches are something loved and eaten around the world and come in various forms. Let's dive in and I'll show you how to make my perfect sandwich!

## 1. **_Prepare_** and **_Gather_** your Ingredients

This is everything you'll need to make my perfect sandwich!

- Hoagie Roll
- Deli-sliced Smoked Turkey
- Shredded Lettuce
- Provolone Cheese
- Kewpie Mayo
- Spicy Dijon Mustard
  > Feel free to use the ingredients you love for your own perfect sandwich!

## 2. **_Slice_** and **_Toast_** your Bread

You can buy pre-sliced bread from the store, but I like to buy hoagie rolls so I'll have to slice it myself. If you don't like toasted bread you can go straight to **_assembling_** your sandwich.

- Placing your bread on a flat surface will help give a stable base so we can cut through the bread cleanly
- Halfway up the height of your roll, run your knife through one end of your roll making sawing motions towards the other end of the roll
- You should now have two relatively even slices of hoagie roll.
- Place them in your toaster and toast until desired level of browning.
- Remove and set aside for assembly.

## 3. **_Assembling_** your Sandwich

All that work is finally gonna pay off, this is the step where we bring it all together!

- With both pieces of bread toasted we can apply our mayo and mustard on both sides. I like to apply enough so just a thin layer is on each slice of bread.
- Add your turkey on one side of the bread, typically the bottom (has a flat outer crust). This will build a sturdy base for the rest of our sandwich
- Directly on top of the meat we add our cheese
- Lastly we add our shredded lettuce on top

## 4. **_Enjoy!_**

Now that the sandwich is built; you can sit back, relax and enjoy the perfect sandwich! Whatever ingredients you choose, it will be the perfect sandwich becuase what's more perfect than a sandwich you made with your own hands.
